    A component is the low-level structure of a StratifiedExperiment that stores a sequence of

    In the case of standard rb, a component is simply the rb Clifford sequence whose end

    be run with 4^n different measurements.

    Note that in standard rb the result of interest for a given sequence is the "survival
    probability" which is essentially just the shifted z expectation of the sequence end-state.
    In unitarity the result of interest for a sequence is a purity--this is calculated from the
    expectations of the 4^n expectations that are stored in the 4^n ExperimentResults individual
